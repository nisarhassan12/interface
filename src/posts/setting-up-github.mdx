At Neon Law, we use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the source code to
run our applications. We also use it to run continuous integration and
continuous delivery scripts using GitHub actions, and we use it to host
Docker images for our software development team to use for local development
and in GitHub Actions scripts.

Setting up GitHub is pretty simple, and there are numerous great resources
available on GitHub to learn Git. We recommend https://try.github.io/ to
jumpstart your training and usage of GitHub.

We also want to sincerely thank the authors and contributors of open source
libraries, many of which are hosted on GitHub, that we have used to jumpstart
and accelerate our software development.

Some of the great projects we use include:

* [Gatsby.JS](https://gatsbyjs.org)
* [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
* [React.JS](https://reactjs.org)
* [Postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)
* [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [Docker](https://docker.com)
