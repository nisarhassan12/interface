Like many of you, we have been blindsided by COVID-19 and its rapid affect on
our lives. Our hearts are with those who have become sick, those that have
passed on, and the selfless warriors administering their healthcare. Our
healthcare workers are true heroes, and **we can't thank them enough**.

We have been worried about our family and friends, especially the old and our
newly born, and are trying to make best of this situation. While we are
staying at home until it is safe (which hopefully means a cure and a
vaccine!) to come out again, we are still available to help you and yours.

If you have questions about a legal dilemna, or just need someone to chat
with (we get it, we're lonely to), please book a free [30-minute consultation
with us](https://neonlaw.cliogrow.com/book/xRg6TK0beg2sHsoIf81FkQ).
