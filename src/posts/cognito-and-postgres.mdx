In this blog post, we will walk through using AWS Cognito, a service that
authenticates or identifies users, with Postgres, a SQL database used to
store data.

AWS Cognito is an IAM-as-a-service, meaning that you can use Cognito in your
applications to identify who is making a request. AWS Cognito it pairs well
with AWS's AppSync and Lambda because when set up properly, your API
functions will be called with a "current user" parameters. For instance, if I
have a GraphQL query `listBuckets` that is protected by an AWS Cognito User
Pool, I am always guaranteed to know who made the `listBuckets` request
because that user must have been previously authenticated by AWS Cognito.

PostgreSQL, or simply Postgres, is a SQL data store with a long history of
open source contributions. It is battle-tested and is used in production at
many companies, and has been for years. When adding authentication logic to a
project that uses Postgres as a datastore, database administrators typically
add a `User` table, and tables for authorization, which answer questions like
"Is this person a user?" In a `Role` table that is joined to a `User` table.

When writing applications with AppSync and Lambda, you have the option of
connecting to a PostgreSQL database and using it as a datastore. For
instance, in our earlier example of `listBuckets`, the list of buckets can
come from a Postgres query `SELECT * FROM buckets`. If you only wanted admin
users to access that list of buckets, you could search your Postgres table
for the user based on the information from Cognito, check if they're an
admin, and return the list of buckets if and only if that user is admin.

In this article, we will go over how to set up Cognito, AppSync, Lambda, and
Postgres, and how to sync users in AWS Cognito and your Postgres instance, so
that you can seamlessly return the correct logic based on who that user is,
and what type of authorizations that user has.

## CloudFormation for Cognito, AppSync, Lambda, and Postgres

AWS CloudFormation is a way you can declare what AWS resources you want to
use.

In [these
templates](https://gist.github.com/shicholas/00f138eebd5ee7a02a9733d9933f0bf2)
a Cognito, an AppSync API and two lambda functions for Cognito handling and
API logic get created. Please note that these functions require a database
URL, or a Postgres database URL, to be inputted into these templates as a
parameter.

Additionally, the Cognito template makes an assumption that the username of
the users authenticating into the Cognito User Pool and subsequently your
application is their email address. This email address must be confirmed by
confirming a code sent to that email before a user is authorized to log on.
It also creates authorization groups, which can be returned to the client
from Cognito. In this case, the `admin` group is created. If we sync our user
roles from our database to Cognito upon creating a user role, then we do not
need to make a trip to the database when looking up the user's roles.
Instead, that information will be immediately available when the user
authenticates into Cognito.

### Database Design

In order to prepare our database for our Cognito users, we should create the
following tables with the following column.

* A User Table
  * The primary ID
  * The Sub, or primary ID from Cognito
  * email address, stored in citext, or case insensitive text.
  * the phone number of the user
* A Role Table
  * The primary ID
  * The unique name of the Role
* A User/Role Join Table
  * The Primary ID of the User
  * The Primary ID of the Role

### Using the Post Confirmation Hook From Cognito to Create a User in Your Database

Within Cognito User Pools, you can set up Lambda functions to be called when
certain hooks happen. One of those hooks is the "Post Confirmation Lambda
Trigger" hook which fires right after Cognito confirms a user's email address
when a user enters the correct code sent to their email. In that hook, you
can create a row in your User table containing the user's email and sub
passed in from Cognito.

### Adding a user to a group after creating a user role

When creating authorizations for a user, you can first do it by saving it to
the database. Since the database is usually the ultimate source of truth in
data-driven applications, it should always reflect your true intent of what
user should have that role. After creating or deleting a user role in your
Postgres database, you can then reflect that user's authorizations in Cognito
by adding or removing them to a group. In Node, the code to add a user to a
group looks like this:

```js
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
AWS.config.update({ region: 'us-east-1' });
AWS.config.setPromisesDependency(require('bluebird'));

const createUserRole = async () => {
 await saveUserRoleToPostgres();
 await cognitoIdentityServiceProvider
   .adminAddUserToGroup({
     GroupName: pr.role.name,
     UserPoolId: userPoolId,
     Username: email,
   })
   .promise();
};
```

## Conclusion

And that's it! By now you should be able to authenticate users into your
application and have an accurate reflection of what users and authorizations
exist in your application's data-store, which in this article was Postgres.
You can create similar tables in other datastores to achieve a similar
syncing of data from Cognito to your application.
