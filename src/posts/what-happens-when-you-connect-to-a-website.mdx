Websites use the TCP protocol, or transmission control protocol, to exchange
information from two computers, typically your computer and the Internet. The
exchange starts with a three-way handshake, which looks like this:

* SYN - your browser sends a synchronize call to initiate a connection.
* SYN/ACK - the server acknowledges your browser's SYN call and sends it's SYN on its own.
* ACK - your browser acknowledges the server's TCP Packet.

When sending data, each client keeps track of a sequence number to determine
how much data has been sent over the wire. The sequence number and
acknowledgment number should change upon each packet interchange and is
usually incremented by the number of bytes being sent over the wire. For
example, when a client sends 40 bytes over the wire, the receiving client may
increment its acknowledgment number by 40. Then when that client sends the
next TCP packet out, the new sequence number is often the previous
acknowledgment number. While TCP has a max size of 65,535 bytes, you can use
the window scale option to scale that beyond that number. The back and forth
between two computers over TCP continues until the final client sends a FIN
TCP packet, which is used to end the connection. It must be acknowledged on
both sides.
