At Neon Law, we use [Terraform](https://terraform.io) to declare our
infrastructure, which at the time of this writing, mainly resides on Google
Cloud Platform. Terraform is a great use-case for software infrastructure
management because it is declarative, or in other words, what you write is
what you get after `apply`-ing the Terraform code to one of your providers.
We also like how Terraform can be used with multiple providers, such as GCP,
but also AWS, Heroku, CloudFlare, and many other great SaaS Providers; by
only writing Terraform code, we can leverage and use many other great SaaS
providers to provide our clients with cheap, efficient, legal services.

Terraform has great documentation on [how to get
started](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) and we recommend anyone
doing so to implement Terraform in real life, perhaps on their own Google
Cloud Platform account where the cost of spinning up nominal servers is
affordable.

In addition to writing infrastructure with Terraform, we also leverage
[Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) because it tracks the state of
our cloud infrastructure and responds to push events from our GitHub
repository, which contains Terraform code for our staging and production
Terraform workspaces, and shared modules such as our
`Google Kubernetes Engine` module, which creates a GKE cluster in our
favorite region, `us-west4`, or fabulous Las Vegas.

We are happy to answer any questions about how to set up a GKE cluster such
as the one powering this website using Terraform. However, for more detailed
consulting, we recommend the services of [Top Flight
Apps](https://topflightapps.com/) who can turn any software idea into a real
executable application.
