If you have python tests that want to exercise writing and reading to a
database, you may find it helpful to wrap each test in a database transaction
so any records created are automatically deleted.

You can elegantly accomplish this using
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and Python decorators, with code
like this:

```python
def run_test_in_database_transaction(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def inner_function(*args, **kwargs):
        db_session.begin(subtransactions=True)

        try:
            await func(*args, **kwargs)
        finally:
            db_session.rollback()
            db_session.close()

    return inner_function
```

Then in your test you can write:


```python
@run_test_in_database_transaction
def test_reading_users():
    # create some users
    # read some users
```

No matter what database records, in this case, users you create, your records
will be deleted at the end of the test because they happen within a
transaction that is always rolled back.
