An EIN, or an Employer Identification Number, is a unique identifier issued
by the ID for your company. This is the number the IRS will use to track the
payroll and other taxes you pay out, and banks will use this number to verify
your company upon opening and managing your bank account.

## Applying for an EIN over the Internet

To apply for an EIN [visit this
website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).
There are steps there to walk you through the process.

## Applying by Mail

Alternatively, you can apply by mail by submitting an SS-4 form to the IRS.
You can read the instructions on how to do so
[here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iss4). You will most likely need to
file an SS-4 form if you have been rejected online by the IRS with error code
101, which usually means a similar business has applied for an EIN before.
