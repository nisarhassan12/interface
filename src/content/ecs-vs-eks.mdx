ECS, or [Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), is a great
simple way to deploy containers if you and your team are committed to using
[Amazon Web Services](https://www.aws.amazon.com).
[Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io), on the other hand is an open-sourced
solution that can run on any cloud and on-prem environment. We believe AWS is
easier to set up and work with, however, it may not be the best case for
everyone as some teams may prefer a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud setup, and
full admin access to all of their software processes running production.

## Clusters & Services

Both ECS and Kubernetes have the concept of "clusters". A cluster is a set of
computers that can run one or more set of containers, and services refer to a
group of containers that are running. For example, if you're running a web
application, a cluster can be defined as a group of servers running in a
provisioned network (e.g. a VPC in AWS), and a service can refer to a
load-balanced distribution of containers that are running your API process.
In each of ECS and Kubernetes, you can think of them as more or less the same
when starting to build application on either platform.

> On AWS, you can choose your deployment to be "serverless" by choosing the
> Fargate runtime. By choosing this option, you can offload more of the work
> in managing clusters and services to AWS, because you no longer have to
> choose the size of your computing instances, or where they run. AWS offers
> the Fargate runtime for both ECS and [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks), or
> their managed version of Kubernetes.

## Task Definitions and Tasks // Pods, Replica Sets, and Deployments

In between, services and clusters in both systems is defining what processes
you want to run and how many of those processes you want to spin up. In ECS,
defining these processes is known as a task definitions, and contains one or
more containers to be run as a single unit. For instance, you can define a
task definition that contains your API container, and a Datadog container in
the same task for application performance monitoring.

In Kubernetes, these are known as pods and have a similar meaning. You can
define the same API + Sideloaded APM container as a pod, which can be one or
more containers. Another example of a pod with two containers is using Google
Cloud's SQL Proxy container to sideload containers.

In ECS the task definition is invoked,
