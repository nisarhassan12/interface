A collection of advice from attorneys:

> "There’s nothing that can help you right now as much as networking. Resumes
> are unlikely to find you a job."

> "Reach out to your resources. Professors. Former employers. Whoever can get
> you the ear of someone doing what you want to do."

> "Don’t shirk your application materials. Mistakes here make it really easy
> to take you off the pile."

> "Look at this time as about getting experience, not fancy titles or firms.
> Experience will get you ready for the next opportunity."
