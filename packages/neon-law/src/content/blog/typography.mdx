We use the following, open-source fonts in our web applications and in our
writing. This website uses WOFF2 files, which are gzipped in transit by Nginx.
We also host TTF versions of these files on this website to accommodate for
older browsers and PDFs, which is the standard format we use for legal
correspondences.

## Headings in Jost

For our headings like the "Headings in Jost" heading above, we use [Jost by
indestructable type](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html).

## Website Copy in HK Grotesk

For our regular text, we use [HK Grotesk by
Hanken](https://hanken.co/products/hk-grotesk).

## Code in Fira Mono

For code blocks, we use Fira Mono, a font produced for and used by Mozilla.
```
