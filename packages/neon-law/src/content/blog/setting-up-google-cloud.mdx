We chose to deploy our services on Google Cloud because as a G Suite user, we
get a Google Cloud account out-of-the-box. Google Cloud, or GCP, has first
class support for Kubernetes, which we use to deploy our applications
including the website you are reading now, and provides us with managed
state-containers, namely a PostgreSQL database and a file store, Storage
Buckets, that we use to securely store our clients' information.

Our Google Cloud is set up with our [Terraform
Repo](https://github.com/neonlaw/infrastructure), which you can use to set up
a similar infrastructure. We also have a GCP project for our internal Google
Docs applications, which help our lawyers streamline the creation of
templates we use to deliver our services more efficientnly - these are not
included in our Terraform scripts.
